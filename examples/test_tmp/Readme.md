## Example with basic-crud-application app

The basic-crud-application app is taken from the official [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/blob/main/examples/basic-crud-application) repository. Currently only the basic one is implemented. The one with `postgres` is not implemented yet.

The only thing that differs is the server implementation. The current one use socketioxide.
